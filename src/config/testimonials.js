    quote: "They do an amazing job! They worked quickly and efficiently and the end results are better than any other painters we have had. They found a few boards that needed to be replaced and they could take care of that for us.  Saving us from having to coordinate getting someone else out. They did the whole exterior of our house.",

    quote: "both me and our company natural stone design.  We have worked with and recommended Ricardo and his company D & R painting. to our clients, so that they can carry out remodeling and painting work in their homes, and we have worked with them for more than 5 years and we continue to recommend them, for their good work of excellent quality, cleanliness and organization, and with a good price , for a first-class quality of service, and with so many years working and recommending it, we have never had a negative call from our clients, if not quite the opposite, our clients call us to thank us for the recommendation we gave them, and that says a lot for us as we are a growing company, and for us the service of our clients has to be of first quality, because we have to maintain a good name in this very competitive market, and the only way to maintain ourselves is by doing and working with companies that think and work the same way we do. so I would never hesitate to recommend Ricardo and his company, so without further ado, do yourself a favor and avoid headaches, and you can no longer find many serious companies in this market that perform top quality work and services, You, as its customers, will not regret it. You will continue using it for a long time, just like us. 😉",
